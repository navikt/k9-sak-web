Combined
========

This directory is meant to contain code that is the result of combining types/code from various backend specific directories
into something that (potentially) is used towards different backends.

This is needed e.g. when the frontend has a defined component prop type that might contain data that is sent to either k9-sak or k9-klage,
based on the case type.
